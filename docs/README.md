## Upshot from the draft design
- Functions can have an additional type parameter list that uses square brackets but otherwise looks like an ordinary parameter list: `func F[T any](p T) { ... }`.
- These type parameters can be used by the regular parameters and in the function body.
- Types can also have a type parameter list: `type M[T any] []T`.
- Each type parameter has a type constraint, just as each ordinary parameter has a type: `func F[T Constraint](p T) { ... }`.
- Type constraints are interface types.
- The new predeclared name any is a type constraint that permits any type.
- Interface types used as type constraints can have a list of predeclared types; only type arguments that match one of those types satisfy the constraint.
- Generic functions may only use operations permitted by the type constraint.
- Using a generic function or type requires passing type arguments.
- Type inference permits omitting the type arguments of a function call in common cases.
